## STRENGTHS 

### Interpersonal Skills
I have been commended for my calming influence in a team. Collaborative working and Agile methodologies were essential for the successful delivery of my final project at Makers. Whilst creating a speech recognition game, I helped ensure team members were working to the best of their abilities by remaining focused and  communicating constantly. Issues such as enabling the speech recognition engine to understand voice input were challenges. This example was resolved by combining some team members’ advanced knowledge in the Dialogflow API with others’ knowledge of Java. Pair programming and mobbing were essential to all of the Makers projects’ success. I enjoy this way of working. 

### Logical Thinking 
I create storyboards to plan out work. When I was required to re-create Facebook using Ruby on Rails,  I structured the order and layout of each page, which links lead to where and the flow of the whole site before I started to make it. This is a typical way of working for me.   

### Patience 
The coding tasks set in the self guided learning part of Makers’ course were extremely challenging and required an extensive process of trial and error. However, I was successful at completing the module. I am tenacious and driven to find solutions.  

### Curiosity 
After using text editors for all of my coding, I was curious about how they work and what goes in to certain features such as syntax highlighting.  I have now started to make my own text editor so that I can fully understand what goes in to making one. 

### Ambition 
I have a thirst for knowledge. I love to experience new things, learn new skills and travel the world. I want to contribute my strengths to an organisation that will invest in my professional development and support me to becoming a Senior Software Developer, leading a team of people to create an innovative product.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (April 2019 - July 2019)

Regarded as Europe's #1 coding bootcamp, Makers is a 16 week programming course that enables students to become full stack developers by means of self-directed learning, object oriented programming, pair programming, TDD, Agile methodologies and XP values.

##### Languages:

* Ruby
  * Ruby on Rails

* Javascript
  * JQuery
  * React

* Java

* HTML

* CSS
  * Bootstrap

##### Testing frameworks: 

* Rspec

* Capybara

* Jasmine

* JUnit 4

##### Databases and management

* PostgreSQL

* Active Record


##### Other: 

* Version control (Git)

* Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (Travis, Heroku, Circle CI)

Our day-to-day group working schedule involved morning standups to discuss and plan out our day, then regular meetings during the day to keep track of how we've been working, and finally a retro at the end of the day. I can work well in either pair programming or mobbing with a team, depending on which style is best suited for the task at hand. 


#### Academy of Contemporary Music (September 2007 - July 2009)

- Diploma, Music
- Grade: Merit
- Performance education that focused on drumming and also included theory (grade 8 theory achieved)

## Interests

**Music:** I have played drums for 20 years, and still play every day. Learning to play drums has given me a dedication to completing a task, and the ability to think laterally; especially as the music I play can be in very unusual time signatures. I play in two local bands with my friends and try to keep as active as I can in the music scene. 

**Computing:** Building computers! I have built many PCs over the past 5 years. I have built small business PCs and large gaming PCs, and enjoy the research of which parts are the most effective for each build. I have been interested in computer hardware since our first computer we had in 1993, and have been very involved in gaming since that time too.
