A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.

## Experience

**Anvil Mobile Ltd** (September 2010 - April 2019)    
*Support and Provisioning*  

I was instrumental in the founding of this start-up telecommunications company. I lead on handling maintenance requests and track issues raised through the service desk ticket system. I was the first point of contact for diagnosis of problems via email, website and phone calls from clients. Responsible for quality control; I updated and maintain the IT support and internal procedures documents including the ISO 9001 certification


## Interests

**Music:** I have played drums for 20 years, and still play almost every day. Learning to play drums has given me a dedication to completing a task, and the ability to think laterally; especially as the music I play can be in very unusual time signatures. I play in two local bands with my friends and try to keep as active as I can in the music scene. 

**Computing:** Building computers! I have built many PCs over the past 5 years and I'm always happy to start on the next one. I have always been interested in computer hardware since our first computer we had in 1993.
