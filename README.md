## Interests

**Music:** I have played drums for 20 years, and still play almost every day. I play in two local bands with my friends and try to keep as active as I can in the music scene. 

**Computing:** Building computers! I have built many systems over the past 5 years and I'm always happy to start on the next one. Sourcing, building, and getting everything to work correctly can sometimes be hard work but it's all very fun.
