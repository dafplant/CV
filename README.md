I am a junior software developer and recent graduate from Makers Academy, the premier software development bootcamp in Europe. I have a background in Music and Telecommunications, and I am looking for a role that enables me to be creative in a collaborative and exciting environment, and one that is challenging in which I can utilise the skills I have learned so far, and to continue to learn and solidify my knowledge of software development.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (April 2019 - July 2019)

Regarded as Europe's #1 coding bootcamp, Makers is a 16 week programming course that enables students to become full stack developers by means of self-directed learning, object oriented programming, pair programming, TDD, Agile methodologies and XP values.

##### Languages:

* Ruby
  * Ruby on Rails

* Javascript
  * JQuery
  * React

* Java

##### Testing frameworks: 

* Rspec

* Capybara

* Jasmine

* JUnit 4

##### Databases and management

* PostgreSQL

* Active Record


##### Other: 

* Version control (Git)

* Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (Travis, Heroku, Circle CI)

Our day-to-day group working schedule involved morning standups to discuss and plan out our day, then regular meetings during the day to keep track of how we've been working, and finally a retro at the end of the day. I can work well in either pair programming or mobbing with a team, depending on which style is best suited for the task at hand. 


#### Academy of Contemporary Music (September 2007 - July 2009)

- Diploma, Music
- Grade: Merit
- I was part of the video team at ACM, to record and help interview artists that came to visit, talk and perform at clinics. 


## Experience

**Anvil Mobile Ltd** (September 2010 - April 2019)    
*Support and Provisioning*  

I was instrumental in the founding of this start-up telecommunications company. I lead on handling maintenance requests and track issues raised through the service desk ticket system. I was the first point of contact for diagnosis of problems via email, website and phone calls from clients. Responsible for quality control; I updated and maintain the IT support and internal procedures documents including the ISO 9001 certification


## Interests

**Music:** I have played drums for 20 years, and still play almost every day. Learning to play drums has given me a dedication to completing a task, and the ability to think laterally; especially as the music I play can be in very unusual time signatures. I play in two local bands with my friends and try to keep as active as I can in the music scene. 

**Computing:** Building computers! I have built many PCs over the past 5 years and I'm always happy to start on the next one. I have always been interested in computer hardware since our first computer we had in 1993.
