I am a junior software developer and recent graduate from Makers Academy, the premier software development bootcamp in Europe. I have a background in Music and Telecommunications, and I am looking for a role that enables me to be creative in a collaborative and exciting environment, and one that is challenging in which I can utilise the skills I have learned so far, and to continue to learn and solidify my knowledge of software development.

## Skills

#### Teamwork and Communication

* Worked in a team on multiple projects at Makers, all using Agile methodologies. We ensured all of the team members were working to the best of their abilities and communicated constantly to make sure that we were happy with the work we were doing, and if there were any issues that we as a team could resolve. Pair programming and mobbing have been essential to projects.

#### Self directed learning

For seven years before I went to study Music, I was a completely self-taught drummer. I learned everything from the basics to the most advanced techniques by reading books, watching videos and learning by ear. This has given me confidence to learn new subjects and to persist independently if necessary. 

At Makers there is an emphasis on independent, self directed learning. It is an important tool for software development when group work is not the most effective use of time. During the course I have learned good ways and make good use of independent learning to further my knowledge, and has given me confidence to learn new technologies and to quickly understand their fundimentals.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (April 2019 - July 2019)

Regarded as Europe's #1 coding bootcamp, Makers is a 16 week programming course that enables students to become full stack developers by means of self-directed learning, object oriented programming, pair programming, TDD, Agile methodologies and XP values.

##### Languages:

* Ruby
  * Ruby on Rails

* Javascript
  * JQuery
  * React

* Java

##### Testing frameworks: 

* Rspec

* Capybara

* Jasmine

* JUnit 4

##### Databases and management

* PostgreSQL

* Active Record


##### Other: 

* Version control (Git)

* Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (Travis, Heroku, Circle CI)

Our day-to-day group working schedule involved morning standups to discuss and plan out our day, then regular meetings during the day to keep track of how we've been working, and finally a retro at the end of the day. I can work well in either pair programming or mobbing with a team, depending on which style is best suited for the task at hand. 


#### Academy of Contemporary Music (September 2007 - July 2009)

- Diploma, Music
- Grade: Merit
- Performance education that focused on drumming and also included theory (grade 8 theory achieved)
- I was part of the video team at ACM, to record and help interview artists that came to visit, talk and perform at clinics.

Responsible for quality control; I updated and maintain the IT support and internal procedures documents including the ISO 9001 certification. 

Daily tasks: 

* Hardware/Software support for 4G equipment: SIMs, routers, bonding units, switches. Networking information and records pertaining to usage of SIM data.

* Provisioning of SIMs on six UK and European networks

## Interests

**Music:** I have played drums for 20 years, and still play every day. Learning to play drums has given me a dedication to completing a task, and the ability to think laterally; especially as the music I play can be in very unusual time signatures. I play in two local bands with my friends and try to keep as active as I can in the music scene. 

**Computing:** Building computers! I have built many PCs over the past 5 years. I have built small business PCs and large gaming PCs, and enjoy the research of which parts are the most effective for each build. I have been interested in computer hardware since our first computer we had in 1993, and have been very involved in gaming since that time too.
